# How a Requirements Analyzer Tool Can Cut Engineering Development Costs by 30%
During product development, we often focus heavily on validation metricsâ€”test coverage, bug rates, and release velocity. However, when activities like requirements development and systems architecture are involved, measurable insights are often underemphasized. These areas are typically guided by experience and intuition rather than objective metrics.
Over the last decade, working across multiple engineering teams, I noticed this gap remained a persistent topic of discussion. This constant struggle inspired me to develop a Requirements Analyzer tool: an automated approach to quantifying the quality of text-based requirements by measuring their completeness, correctness, and clarity.
## The Business Case: Reducing Manual Review Overhead
According to research, teams spend nearly 20% of development time [^1] on requirements-related activities, including requirements development and multiple rounds of stakeholder reviews. While necessary, these reviews are time-consuming and often subjective. 
The Requirements Analyzer streamlines this process by automating the evaluation of requirement quality. Based on internal trials, it can significantly reduce manual stakeholder review time, resulting in substantial savings across large programs.
### How the Tool Works
The tool accepts text-based requirement documents as input. Leveraging the OpenAI API, it analyzes each requirement for:
  - Correctness: Is the requirement technically sound and atomic enough?
  - Completeness: Are all relevant details included and dependencies with other requirements considered?
  - Clarity â€“ Is the language unambiguous?
It then provides a satisfaction score, feedback, and actionable recommendations to strengthen requirements rated at a lower score. This helps requirement engineers and authors improve their work early in the development cycle, mitigating the time and cost of a rework spiral.
### Example: Motion Control System for Autonomous Vehicles
As a demonstration, I tested the tool using safety requirements for a motion control actuation system designed for an autonomous vehicle application. The input included functional and technical safety requirements derived from an example safety concept. The Requirements Analyzer evaluated the document and generated a satisfaction score of 6.5/10, indicating that the requirements needed refinement. The feedback helps the team identify gaps and inconsistencies and provides actionable insights that might have otherwise surfaced much later during implementation or testing.

## Conclusion
By integrating AI-driven feedback into early development stages, this tool empowers teams to write better requirements, faster. It bridges the long-standing gap in objectively assessing requirement quality, saving valuable engineering time and cost.
If your team is still relying solely on manual reviews to validate requirement quality, it might be time to explore smarter, scalable solutions like this one.
